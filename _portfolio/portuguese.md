# The Idea

Why did I create this program? 

I created this program because I love learning new languages. I think its amazing learning what unique phrases different languages have, and how even within a language there are different words and expressions based on the region where it is spoken. I taught myself Spanish in the summer of 2023. How did I do it? I started with the verbs. I first learned how to conjugate the top 100 verbs in the present tense for yo, tu, ella/el/usted, nosotros, ellas/ellos/ustedes. Then I moved onto the preterite, then the past perfect, and I made my way through all the tenses, only studying the verbs. Once I knew the top 100, then the top 300 most used verbs, I began to read sentences, then articles, and eventually books, all started on my basic knowledge of the Spanish verbs.

The purpose of explaining my journey with learning Spanish was to highlight how I learned it by focusing on verbs. Learning the verbs and how to conjugate them allowed me to learn Spanish in a very efficent and effective way. So, when I decided that the next language I wanted to tackle was Portuguese, I decided I wanted to do it in the same way, start with the verbs. 

The issue with this approach, as I found out, is there is no program out there that allows you to just practice Portuguese verbs. When I learned Spanish, I used an app called Ella Verbs, which was for Spanish only. I could not find a program that was as effective that focuses on learning Portuguese verbs only. I knew this was the way I wanted to learn it, so since I couldn't find a suitable program for me online, I created it.

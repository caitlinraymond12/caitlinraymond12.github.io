Something I love to do is cook. it's a way for me to relax and create something, and there's nothing I love more than creating things!

Check out some of the recent dishes I've been cooking for my family and friends:



## Chicken Tikki Masla with Garlic Naan

<br/><img src='/images/Cooking/Tikki Masla.JPG'>

This is one of my favorite dishes I've made. I made everything from scratch, including the garlic naan! The chicken tikki masala was suprisingly easy, just a marinate, then sear, then make the sauce from cream and spices, then add the chicken and it's ready to go! The garlic naan, however,  was quite the journey. I made the dough a few different times because I kept messing up the proportions. And when I finally got the dough right, then making the small circles and cooking them without tearing them was the issue. But eventually, I got one that turned out good, and after that I had the strategy down. This was a really fun dish to make and tasted even better.

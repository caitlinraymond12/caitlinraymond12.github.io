Something I love to do is cook. It's a way for me to relax and create something, and there's nothing I love more than creating things!

Check out some of the recent dishes I've been cooking for my family and friends:



## Chicken Tikka Masala with Garlic Naan

<br/><img src='/images/Cooking/Tikki Masla.JPG'>

This is one of my favorite dishes I've made. I made everything from scratch, including the garlic naan! The chicken tikka masala was suprisingly easy. First you marinate the chicken in yogurt and various spices, once the marinade is done you sear it, then finsih cooking it in the sauce. To make the sauce, it's simply onion, garlic, tomato pasta, cream, and various spices. The spices used are cumin, garam masla, tumeric, corriander, cayenne pepper, and ground ginger.  

 The garlic naan, however,  was quite the journey. I made the dough a few different times because I kept messing up the proportions. And when I finally got the dough right, making the small circles and cooking them without tearing them became the issue. But eventually, I got one that turned out good, and after that I had the strategy down. This was a really fun dish to make and tasted amazing.

It took a while, and after many, many, failed attempts, I was finally able to make naan bread!


**Quick History:**
Chicken tikka masala is one of the dishes people often assosicate with indian cuisine, but the story of its origin is heavily debated. One widely accepted story of its origin was that it was created by a Bengali chef in Gasglow, Scotland. A customer ordered chicken curry, but complained it was too dry, so the chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam, combined the chicken curry with a can of tomato soup, and created the Chicken Tikka Masala dish. However, some others believe it was simply derived from its sister dish, butter chicken, in northen India. 


## Mushroom Risotto

This is a dish I made as a request from one of my friends, although I had no experience cooking risotto before. It's a very slow process, taking about an hour in total to complete. The essenece of this dish is you slowly cook arborio rice with chicken stock. You add a little bit, stir until its fully absored, then add a little more, stir, and repeat this process until it's fully cooked. The reason why arborio rice is used is because it has a high starch content, which helps to create a thick, creamy "sauce" for the risotto, as well as prevent it from becoming mushy. The mushrooms were cooked in a seperate pan and added in at the very end. 

**Quick History:**
Rice was brought into Northern Italy and Northern Spain by the Arabs in around the 1500s. The climate of these areas ended up being great to grow short-grained rice in, the type that is used in risotto. Slow-cooking food was a common way to enjoy any dish in these regions, and people began to slow cook rice in this way, slowly boiling it with broth until it was ready to eat. In Italy, Risotto can be served as a main dish or simply as a starter dish. 



## Tomato Confit with Burratta, Arugula, and Pesto Sandwich

This sandwich had so many different parts and actually ended up taking a really long time, but in the end it was so worth it and so much fun to make. I started early by preparing the tomato garlic confit, which is essentially just slow cooking something in oil. Then I made the pesto, and finally toasted the bread and assembled it all. The burrata was good but it made it a little messy, and if I had to do it again I would use fresh mozzeralla instead.

**What is a Confit?**
A confit actually isn't a certain type of food, but rather refers to a certain way of cooking, or preserving food. It orginates from "confire", a french verb that means "to preserve". A wide variety of things can be confit, garlic confit, tomato confit, meat confit, even fruit confit! To confit something, you must cook it in oil at a *low temperature.* Making a confit should take a few hours, because you want to be sure you don't accidently fry your food, and instead tenderize it and pull all those delicious flavors from it into the oil.

**What is Burrata?**
Burrata is essentially a ball of cheese. On the inside, there's a mixture of cream and shredded cheese or cheese curds. The outside porition is a just a shell of mozzarella. It's meant to be cut open and have its insides spread over whatever dish is being served. 

**What is Pesto?**
Pesto is a mixture of a few different ingredients:
* Basil
* Garlic
* Olive Oil
* Pine Nuts
* Parmesan/Pecorino Romano 
* Lemon

It's not very hard to make, just requires some sort of mixing device and all the above ingredients. The best part is it's very easy to modify based on your preferences. 

## Shrimp/Chicken Tacos with Cilantro Lime Crema

Tacos are one of my favorite foods, and I love how many different various there are. These tacos are either shrimp or chicken cooked with a mexican blend of spices, put on toasted corn tortillas, with lettuce, guacamole, cilantro lime crema, and cotija cheese. When making tacos, it's important to toast your tortillas on the stove slighlty before serving, otherwise they will tear when you try to eat them.

I'm a huge fan of ciltantro, which is why I decided to include cilantro lime crema. Traditionally, it's a combination of mexican crema (or sour cream), mayo, lime juice, garlic, onion, cilantro, and salt, and mixed in a blender. In mine, I also mixed it with a little bit of avocado just to give it a more green look to it. 

**Cotija cheese?**
Cotija Cheese is a type of cheese that originated in Mexico, and was named after the town "Cotija de la Paz". It's salty, firm, and crumbly. It's very similar to feta cheese. Typically, you'll find it on elote or esquites, which are mexican corn dishes. However I find that it goes amazing on top of tacos.

Something I love to do is cook. it's a way for me to relax and create something, and there's nothing I love more than creating things!

Check out some of the recent dishes I've been cooking for my family and friends:



## Chicken Tikki Masla with Garlic Naan

<br/><img src='/images/Cooking/Tikki Masla.JPG'>

This is one of my favorite dishes I've made. I made everything from scratch, including the garlic naan! The chicken tikki masala was suprisingly easy, just a marinate, then sear, then make the sauce from cream and spices, then add the chicken and it's ready to go! The garlic naan, however,  was quite the journey. I made the dough a few different times because I kept messing up the proportions. And when I finally got the dough right, making the small circles and cooking them without tearing them became the issue. But eventually, I got one that turned out good, and after that I had the strategy down. This was a really fun dish to make and tasted amazing.

It took a while, and after many failed attempts, I was able to make naan correctly. 


**Quick History**
Chicken tikki masala is one of the dishes people heavily assosicate with indian cuisine, but the story of its origin is heavily debated. One widely accepted story of its origin was that it was created by a Bengali chef in Gasglow, Scotland. A customer ordered chicken curry, but complained it was too dry, so the chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam, combined the chicken curry with a can of tomato soup, and created the Chicken Tikki Masala dish. However, some others believe it was simply derived from its sister dish, butter chicken, in northen India. 


## Mushroom Risotto

This is a dish I made as a request from one of my friends, althought having no experience cooking risotto before. It's a very slow process, taking about an hour in total to complete. The essenece of this dish is you slowly cook arborio rice with chicken stock. You add a little bit, stir until its fully absored, then add a little more, stir, and repeat this process until it's fully cooked. The reason why arborio rice is used is because it has a high starch content, which helps to create a thick, creamy "sauce" for the risotto, as well as prevent it from becoming mushy. The mushrooms were cooked in a seperate pan and added in at the very end. 

**Quick History**
In the 14th century, rice was brought into Northern Italy and Northern Spain by the Arabs. The climate of these areas ended up being great to grow short-grained rice in, the type that is used in risotto. Slow-cooking food was a common way to enjoy any dish in these reasons, and people began to slow cook rice in this way, slowly boiling it with broth until it was ready to eat. In Italty, Risotto is served as a main dish or simply as a starter dish.

## Daily Picture

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# R code to calculate the day of the year
today <- Sys.Date()
day_of_year <- as.numeric(format(today, "%j"))

# List of image filenames
images <- c('image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg', 'image3.jpg')

# Determine the image index
image_index <- (day_of_year - 1) %% length(images) + 1
image_src <- paste0('path/to/your/folder/', images[image_index])

# Output the image URL for use in HTML

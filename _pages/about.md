Student Studying Computer Engineering at the University of Miami.

## About

Hey! My name is Caitlin Raymond, I'm a sophmore at the University of Miami and I'm studying Computer Engineering. I'm originally from Naples, Florida, and some of my hobbies include:



### Music 

I love music and am always trying to expose myseslf to as much as possible. I try to listen to at least one new album a week, and have it on repeat while I'm studying, walking to class, driving, everything. If I am doing an activty where I can listen to music, I will. 


### Skating

Skating has always been a huge part of my life, I've been skating since I was 10 years old! It's a way for me to relax. Sometimes I just love to get away from the online world and back out into the real world. I love falling, I love working on landing a new trick, I love getting to go out and explore new places, and I love finding new friends to go out and skate with. 


### Cooking

 Cooking is something else that I've very passionate about. I've been known to spend all day in my kitchen creating every single part of a dish until it's perfect. I love making foods from all different cultures and learning about the history behind each dish. I think that the best way to learn about a culture and the people is through the food!

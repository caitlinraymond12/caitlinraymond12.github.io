Student Studying Computer Engineering at the University of Miami.

## About

Hey! My name is Caitlin Raymond, I'm a sophmore at the University of Miami and I'm studying Computer Engineering. I'm originally from Naples, Florida, and some of my hobbies include:



### Music 

I love music and am always trying to expose myseslf to as much as possible. I try to listen to at least one new album a week, and have it on repeat while I'm studying, walking to class, driving, everything. If I am doing an activty where I can listen to music, I will. Navigate to the "Music" tab to see what I've been listening to recently!




### Skating
